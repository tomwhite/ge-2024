# Did you stay up for Truss?

## UK General Election 2024 Declaration Times

An animation that relives the night of the Labour landslide.

Made with:

- [D3](https://d3js.org/) for the visualization
- [d3-hexjson](https://github.com/olihawkins/d3-hexjson) to generate hexmaps
- [UK Constituency Data Hex Maps](https://constituencies.open-innovations.org/) for the UK consitituency hex data
- [Winning members with recorded time](<data/Winning-members-(Friday-1720).xlsx>) from the [House of Commons Library](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10009/) for the official declaration times
  - Note that the House of Commons page has since been updated with a spreadsheet of Winning Members that no longer includes declaration times, so I have linked to a copy
- [Colours for UK political parties (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom/Index_of_United_Kingdom_political_parties_meta_attributes) for the colour scheme
